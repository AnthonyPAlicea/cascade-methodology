# Cascade Methodology: Software Development in the AI Age

## Definition

Cascade Methodology is an effort to leverage AI-Assisted Software Development in a modern SDLC, taking advantage of LLM benefits, and mitigating LLM risks.

Cascades are rapid AI-driven development cycles that flow from detailed specifications through interactive prototypes to production code, with verification gates that scale based on business risk tolerance.

To adopt Cascade Methodology means embracing and understanding both the benefits and the dangers of AI-assisted development, and using it to your greatest advantage.

## Values

Here are the values of the Cascade Methodology:

**Cross-disciplinary collaboration over siloed development**  
While individual expertise is important, AI-ready specifications require input from requirements gatherers, designers, and software architects working together.

**User validation over assumption-driven development**
While technical implementation is important, AI-driven prototyping makes comprehensive user research and UX validation essential, rather than optional, first-class activities.

**Rapid experimentation over prolonged planning**  
While initial spec work is necessary for context engineering, AI enables fast prototype-driven learning cycles that feed back into spec work.

**Risk-scaled verification over uniform quality gates**
While consistent quality standards are important, AI-generated code requires verification intensity that matches the entropy tolerance of the business process being supported.

**Learning velocity over feature velocity**  
While shipping features is a core goal, AI allows us to learn more per iteration safely.

## Core Principles

### 1. Specification-Driven Context Engineering
AI systems require detailed, contextual specifications to generate production-quality code. Specifications must include business requirements, technical constraints, and the underlying problem rationale.

### 2. Entropy-Scaled Verification
Verification intensity scales with the entropy tolerance of the business process being supported. High-risk processes require dense verification gates; low-risk processes enable porous gates.

### 3. Experiment-Driven Validation
Interactive prototypes generated by AI enable comprehensive user research and technical validation before production implementation.

### 4. Verification-Bounded Scope
Development scope is constrained by team verification capacity at the required entropy tolerance level, preventing AI-enabled scope creep.

### 5. Rapid Learning Cycles
AI acceleration enables testing larger feature sets and more complex interactions within single development cycles, expanding the scope of learning by expanding the scope of features when verification capacity allows. Specifications evolve from hypotheses to experiments to living documentation, supporting continuous learning and rapid pivoting even post-deployment.

## The Cascade Structure

A cascade is a complete development cycle from specification to deployment, consisting of five phases:

```
1. SPEC ←──────────────┐
   ↓                   │
2. EXPERIMENT ─────────┘
   ↓
3. IMPLEMENT
   ↓
4. VERIFY
   ↓
5. DEPLOY
```

### Phase 1: Specification
Creation of detailed requirements that serve as both human documentation and AI context. Specifications are hypotheses about user needs and technical solutions.

### Phase 2: Experiment
AI-generated interactive prototypes enable rapid user research, stakeholder validation, and technical feasibility assessment. Experimentation may iterate back to specification refinement.

### Phase 3: Implementation
Production code generation using specification and experimental findings as context. AI implements validated designs with human oversight.

### Phase 4: Verification
Risk-appropriate quality assurance based on the entropy tolerance of the supported business process. Verification gates range from porous (basic functionality) to dense (comprehensive security and compliance review).

### Phase 5: Deployment
Release of verified code through established deployment pipelines. Teams should implement Verified Integration / Continuous Deployment (VI/CD), where only code that passes entropy-appropriate verification gates is integrated and deployed.

## Entropy Tolerance Framework

### Definition
Entropy tolerance measures how much uncertainty a business process can safely accommodate from AI-generated solutions.

### Assessment Criteria
- **Impact of errors** on business operations
- **Regulatory requirements** and compliance needs
- **Data sensitivity** and privacy implications
- **User safety** and security considerations
- **Financial risk** exposure

### Verification Gate Types

**Porous Gates** (High Entropy Tolerance)
- Marketing content and visual elements
- Internal tools and dashboards
- Experimental features
- Non-critical user interface components

**Medium Gates** (Medium Entropy Tolerance)
- Performance-sensitive components
- Customer support ticket routing and responses
- Product recommendation engines
- User onboarding workflows

**Dense Gates** (Low Entropy Tolerance)
- Financial transaction processing
- Personal data handling systems
- Security and authentication mechanisms
- Regulatory compliance features
- Safety-critical functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### Cascade Planning
1. Define the problem domain and success criteria
2. Assess entropy tolerance of affected business processes
3. Estimate team verification capacity for required gate density
4. Scope features within verification constraints
